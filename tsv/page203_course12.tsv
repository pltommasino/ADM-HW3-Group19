Ecology and Evolution MSc	University of Groningen	Health and Life Sciences	Full time	Which organisms are able to adapt to global change? How do birds decide when and where to migrate? When and why do individual differences in physiology or behaviour evolve?This Master's degree programme has a selection procedure.During the two-year Master's programme Ecology and Evolution you will gain insight into the living organism in relation to its environment. Ecology and evolution are strongly interdependent: without ecology, we cannot really understand natural selection; and without evolution, we cannot really understand the properties of organisms and their interaction with the environment. Ecology and evolution are relevant for all domains of the life sciences.	September	View Website	MSc	2 years full time	Groningen	Netherlands	On Campus
