City Design and Social Science MSc	London School of Economics and Political Science	Department of Sociology	Full time	Ask LSEThe MSc City Design and Social Science focuses on the relations between the social and spatial organisation of cities and urban environments. We see design as a field of research, knowledge and practice that shapes urban environments, responds to urban problems, and integrates social, spatial and political approaches to the city. This ground-breaking programme was launched in 1998. It supports the development of interdisciplinary urban practitioners and scholars who can work across professional divides to have a positive impact on cities as both social and built environments.Â 	September	Ask LSE	MSc	12 months full-time, 24 months part-time	London	United Kingdom	On Campus
