MSc in Neurophysics	Radboud University	Science	Full time	Our brain contains many ingenious networks of billions of interconnected neurons. Together, they have an information processing capacity and flexibility that far exceeds modern supercomputers, or any artificial intelligent system. In this specialisation, we aim at unravelling the neuro-computational mechanisms of this fascinating, complex system using experimental approaches, advanced theory and computational models.﻿Discover our campus and get information on our English-taught programmes during our in-person Master’s Open Day on 23	September	Master’s Open Day on 23	MSc	2 years full time	Nijmegen	Netherlands	On Campus
