Food and Health	University of Padua	School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine	Full time	The Master’s degree in Food and Health addresses the complexity underling the interactions between food, nutrition and human health, in an international context. The programme is framed around the “from food harvest to global health” paradigm. A modern teaching approach aims at filling the existing gaps between the different disciplines, currently offered in this area, within a multidisciplinary, complementary and highly integrated knowledge. The programme offers both strong theoretical courses and applied research-oriented teaching on food production, food quality and human nutrition, in order to understand how they are related and how they affect human health, via dietary habits.
