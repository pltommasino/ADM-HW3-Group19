Animate Materials MSc by Research	Durham University	Department of Chemistry	Full time	About the CourseAnimate materials are a new generation of smart materials that offer huge potential. These new MSc by research projects at Durham University offer graduate students the opportunity to be involved in world leading research into the development of these novel synthetic materials.Â Research ProfileAnimate materials have the potential to transform the world. They could allow us to create materials that use carbon dioxide to self-repair, clothing that can detect illness and buildings that form part of the ecosystem. Although no truly animate materials have yet been created, these are possible and research within the BSI is at the forefront of this field.
