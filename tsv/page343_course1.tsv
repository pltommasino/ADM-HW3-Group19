Logistics and Supply Chain Management MSc	University of Huddersfield	Huddersfield Business School	Full time	This course provides the essential framework, concepts and toolkit required for the strategic management of logistics and the supply chain.Within a business context, it is now recognised that one of the main ways in which competitive advantage can be gained, is through the effective and efficient management of the supply chain - the term used to describe the flow of products or services from their point of origin through to the final point of sale or use. Logistics is essentially an interactive process within the supply chain; it seeks to optimise these flows, from both a physical and information standpoint.
