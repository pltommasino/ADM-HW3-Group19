Systems and Control MSc	University of Groningen	Science and Engineering	Full time	Flying to the moon, monitoring and stabilizing the energy grid, cruise control in a car, unloading a container ship with a crane; these are typical examples of methods from systems and control in action.Systems and Control is an engineering discipline that is concerned with analyzing and influencing dynamical systems that interact with their environment via inputs (influenced via actuators) and outputs (measured via sensors). It is highly multidisciplinary because the underlying mathematical models and methods cover many different domains. These include electronics, mechanics, chemistry, biology, medicine, economy, and social sciences.	September	View Website	MSc	2 years part time	Groningen	Netherlands	On Campus
