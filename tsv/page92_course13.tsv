Artificial Intelligence MSc	University of Groningen	Science and Engineering	Full time	What is intelligent behaviour? How can computers recognize faces and objects? In this programme you will learn how to design and implement intelligent systems.The core topics in the Master's programme Artificial Intelligence are: autonomous perceptive systems, cognitive robotics and multi-agent systems.Autonomous SystemsA robot taking samples and collecting information on the moon is an example of an autonomous system. It operates and carries out missions independently. Regardless of its surroundings, it responds with a certain intelligence. While traditional AI focuses on cognition and reasoning as isolated abilities, we strongly believe in perception as an active behaviour, which is integrated into general cognition.
