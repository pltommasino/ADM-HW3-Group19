Electrical Automotive Engineering MSc	Coventry University	Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing	Full time	Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles constitute a modern and timely area in engineering, one expected to expand very quickly in the next few years.Climate change and the consequent need to reduce CO2 emissions has progressively led to major advances in many modern developments of power engineering such as in photovoltaics, wind turbines and biofuels. The next step, which strongly affects our daily lives, is transportation. Electric vehicles minimise pollution whilst increasing power efficiency. Moreover, areas such as autonomous vehicles and smart transportation grids are beginning to become reality. As a result, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has recommended the government develop EV-specific qualifications for mechanics and engineers.
