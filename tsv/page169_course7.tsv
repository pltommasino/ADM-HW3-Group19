Criminology (Postgraduate Certificate / Postgraduate Diploma / MSc)	University of Gloucestershire	School of Natural, Social and Sport Sciences	Full time	What is Criminology?Criminology is the study of crime, deviance and society – but it is so much more than that. Exploring the way we define, commit, respond to and punish crime is a vast and exciting area of work. We take a ‘real world’ approach to Criminology focusing on what happens at the current time. This also means that you’ll have many opportunities to apply your criminological knowledge in contemporary settings.
