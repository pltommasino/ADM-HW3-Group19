Crime too is complex and is in constant flux, changing in type, scale, spread and impact. Traditional borders and boundaries are increasingly irrelevant, and law enforcement organisations respond by locating their efforts within an international frame of reference, and with a workforce that demonstrates high-quality, specialist law enforcement education.This course will see you develop conceptual and critical insights into contemporary issues in the theory, policy and practice of law enforcement, and apply your learning to your own jurisdictions.
