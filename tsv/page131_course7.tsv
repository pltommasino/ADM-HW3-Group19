Civil Engineering - Master of Science (MS)	University of Colorado Boulder	College of Engineering	Full time	The department's objective is to produce engineers capable of identifying, preventing and solving building, construction and environmental problems. In addition to the well-established graduate programs in environmental, water resource and geotechnical engineering, students in the department may also choose to study in the emerging field of geoenvironmental engineering. Campus facilities, including a National Science Foundation-funded earthquake simulator, permit a case-study approach, which exposes students to real-world problems and allows experimentation, testing and analysis.Areas of study within the Civil Engineering Department are:	See Course	View Website	MSc	Please view website	Boulder	USA	On Campus
