International and World History (LSE-Columbia University) MSc	London School of Economics and Political Science	Department of International History	Full time	Ask LSEOur world is more interconnected than ever. We call it globalisation, but without good histories to explain how we got here, we cannot begin to know where we are heading.This master's programme at Columbia University and LSE asks you to explore our world by studying the forces that have been remaking it; migration, trade, technological revolutions, epidemic disease, environmental change, wars and diplomacy. Working with preeminent historians in the field, you will analyse large-scale historical processes, pursue empirical research and produce your own comparative and cross-cultural histories.
