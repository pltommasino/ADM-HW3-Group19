Behavioural Economics (MSc)	Erasmus School of Economics	Masters Programmes	Full time	Why do people not always act as rational economic decision makers? How can we apply mathematics and psychology to improve our economic models? Contrary to assumptions in traditional economics, people do not automatically choose the optimal course of action, even if given proper incentives. Intrigued? Our Behavioural Economics programme brings you the skills to optimise strategies and policies by including the framing and context that affect peopleâ€™s choices.This skills-based programme addresses the psychology of decision making. In both mainstream and behavioural economics courses you will acquire a deep understanding of economics as well as the skills to adapt strategies and policies to deviations from rational behaviour.
