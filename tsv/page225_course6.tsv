Engineering Project Management (Online) MSc/PgDip/PgCert	University of Strathclyde	Department of Design, Manufacture & Engineering Management	Part time	Engineering project management has been identified as an area with a rocketing increase in global demand, and a huge diversity of roles.It's predicted that there are more project manager positions in the manufacturing and construction sectors than any other – 9.7 million to be exact. While many of these will become available as large numbers of project managers approach retirement, there are also predicted to be a high volume of newly-created positions due to the well-publicised skills gap (The Project Management Job Growth and Talent Gap (2017-2027) report).It is further highlighted that engineering talent, specifically those with skills in project management are scarce and in short supply (jobsite).
