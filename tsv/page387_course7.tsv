Master of Science in Computer Vision	Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence	Masters Programmes	Full time	IntroductionThis scientific field studies how computers can be used to automatically understand and interpret visual imagery. It aims to mimic the astounding capabilities of human visual cortex using machine vision algorithms. It studies how an image is created, the geometry of the 3D world and high-level tasks such as object recognition, object detection, and tracking, image segmentation and action recognition. Computer vision has important applications in augmented/virtual reality, autonomous cars, service robots, biometrics and forensics, remote sensing and security and surveillance.You can apply to the program hereProgram CompetenceUpon completion of the program requirements, the graduate will be able to:	See Course	program here	MSc	12 months	Abu Dhabi	United Arab Emirates	Online
