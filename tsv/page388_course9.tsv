Master of Science in Data Science	Nazarbayev University	Engineering	Full time	Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organizationâ€™s competitive advantage. Advancements in technology helped data science evolve from cleaning datasets and applying statistical methods to a field that encompasses data analysis, predictive analytics, data mining, business intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and so much more.
